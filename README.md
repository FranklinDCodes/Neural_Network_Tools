# Neural_Network_Tools
A tool package that allows a user to create a neural network of any size and shape.

When a neural network is created, it is stored in in a local database using sqlite. The network can be called up from any file in the same directory when the Network class is inited with its name. This respository also contains a sqlite3 tools file that I used to create the neural network tools, a file that displays an example nerual network that I trained, and the file I used to train it.
